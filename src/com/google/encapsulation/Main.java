    // Process of containing information

    // NOTE: Abstraction is different from encapsulation, since it is the hiding the
    // unnecessary details and showing valuable information only.
    // In order to start a Car, do you know to understand how the engine works? Or
    // what happens when you key the ignition?
    // No, you just need to know how to start it. This is abstraction.
    // It's like solving a design level issue
    // Process of gaining information

    // NOTE: Data Hiiding is the process of restricting access to certain details of
    // an
    // object.
    // Encapsulation is a way to achieve data hiding.
    // like a private variable in a class, which is not accessible outside the
    // class.
